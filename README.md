### Project Overview

A **consumer good company** which specialises in wide spectrum of products has collected **b2c demographic** customer data of approx. 8000 customers related to their products and further this particular data is **segmented into segments** by data science team by using unsupervised **clustering techniques (k-means)**. As a data analyst in **product team** your task is to:

i)	Define **key defining characteristic** of each costumer segment to implement targeted marketing.<br>
ii)	What are **behavioural habits** of each customer segment to understand their **needs, preferences and motivations**.<br>
iii)	Define which segment is most **profitable and valuable**.<br>.
